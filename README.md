# Personal Project

# What is it?

It is meant to be an app that gives out a list of items that needs to be filled in a supermarket.
It has data that consist of Stock on hand counts, shelf capacity, and item codes etc.

# Plan of attack

- [x] Clone the boilerplate
- [x] Draw the plan on paper.
- [x] Start the repo:
- [x] Create the README.md file with info about the project.
- [x] Install what is needed(npm, knex, sqlite3).
- [x] Create the server and db.js files
- [x] Make the migration
- [x] Make the seeds
- [x] Create routes folder
- [x] Create views with layouts folder
- [ ] Create the function to display the whole table first
- [ ] Create the functions to add items to the table
- [ ] Create the function to delete items from the table
- [ ] Create the function that update existing items on the table
- [ ] Create the function that has the conditional that will show only selected items needed to fill shelf
- [ ] Double check and play with functions to see if it is working

# Stretch (Can you make it?)
- [ ] Update table by incoming data from checkout sales and stock arriving on delivery
- [ ] Do testing (proper)
